Gtabrews Advent Calendar
================

This is just for a homebrew club I'm in.

- List all the beers in your region
- Edit your assigned beer with whatever information
- Put in your recipe (in Markdown for now) because sharing is caring

# TODO

- Seeding with real data
- Viewing the edit form and updating ones submission
- Testing (lol)
